ML-Powered Multi-Symptom API

This API demonstrates the STRENGTH of ML by:
1. Using trained ML models to predict diseases from symptom combinations
2. Providing probabilistic predictions with confidence scores
3. Learning complex patterns that rule-based systems cannot capture
4. Generalizing to new symptom combinations
5. Handling uncertainty and partial matches intelligently
