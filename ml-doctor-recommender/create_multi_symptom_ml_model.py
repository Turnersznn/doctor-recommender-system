"""
Create a Multi-Symptom ML Model for Disease Prediction and Specialist Recommendation

This demonstrates the STRENGTH of ML by:
1. Learning complex symptom patterns from real medical data
2. Handling multiple symptoms simultaneously 
3. Discovering hidden relationships between symptoms and diseases
4. Providing probabilistic predictions with confidence scores
5. Generalizing to new symptom combinations not seen in training
