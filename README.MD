CHAPTER 1

1.0 INTRODUCTION
Weak access to quality medical care remains a major challenge among geographic territories; patients experience dire challenges in selecting medical professionals that can address their specific needs. The absence of information about providers, such as their respective medical specialization, interpersonal rapport, geographical location, and their professional credibility summarized in peer-level reviews, complicates the decision-making. With the technological progress in the digital field and as artificial intelligence (AI) continues to permeate clinical decision-support systems, the healthcare sector is poised to significantly benefit by the introduction of intelligent recommendation structure.  

This current project has a vision of developing a Doctor Recommender System that combines machine learning and data-driven approaches in order to help create an optimal matching between patients and medical professionals. The system will provide proposals regarding specific doctors depending on the clinical needs, personal aesthetic choices and the specific space data gathered through systematic review. This strategy minimizes the uncertainty of decision-making and the amount of time spent in finding the appropriate medical professionals. Finally, the proposed system aims at optimizing healthcare accessibility, improving the mechanisms of patient-provider matching, and contributing to the optimization of patient outcomes and satisfaction.

The current condition of health service delivery in modern practice is defined by the lack of such comprehensive, web-based resource that would allow patients to find and contact certified doctors efficiently. The combination of current referral systems, outdated and improperly maintained online resources and old fashioned institutional registries cannot strike a proper balance between timely access to care. Often patients do not make decision in receipt of essential information, that is, the availability of physicians, full patient-feedback, and a past view of the quality of services. The combination of user data, real-time provider availability, and the smart matching would help overcome these shortcomings; therefore, an AI-based recommendation platform may allow patient referrals to the most suitable healthcare providers.

The current research is aimed at designing and realising a doctor recommendation system based on the use of modern technologies like machine learning and user behaviour assessment. The system will also incorporate a patient-centric interface, a living, data rich resource of medical practitioners, and a strong recommendation engine that will be able to produce context-sensitive recommendations in accordance with both medical and personal specifications of each user.





1.1 BACKGROUND OF THE STUDY
With the past decade alone, there has been a surge in the demand of efficient and responsive medical service delivery and this has been attributed to the rise in population and urban sprawl as well as a greater focus on patient-centred care. One such setback that perpetuates in this field is inability of patients to decide on a relevant medical practitioner to receive the necessary care amid a wide range of medical specialists available. The procedure of decision making is not limited only by closeness or access, but covers a series of factors, such as medical specialization, clinical experience, patient reviews, the cost of the consultation, and booking appointments.
Conventional approaches to identifying suitable doctors such as reliance on hospital notice boards, informal referrals, or static online directories often prove inadequate and outdated. These modes are usually one-dimensional and do not provide thorough, real-time data that can lead to adequate healthcare choices. As a result patients can experience delays in receiving treatment, directed consultations, and generally be dissatisfied about the quality of healthcare services.
As digital transformation gained pace in multiple industries, recommendation systems have become potent mechanisms of establishing personalized user experiences. E-commerce, digital media, and educational industries have been able to implement algorithm-based recommendation engines in their business to optimize the delivery of their services and consumer satisfaction. In the medical field, analogous systems are under research as such they may help the patients with navigating complicated medical systems and finding the right medical personnel.

A Doctor Recommender System is a smart digital system that uses artificial intelligence and machine learning and provides specific doctor recommendations supported by user-specific parameters and medical needs. When using this system, numerous features such as physician specialty, geographic area, availability in real-time, user reviews, and comments are considered in order to display a filtered list and suggest relevant practitioners to contact.

The integration of data-driven decision-making in the process of selecting a doctor can make healthcare institutions much more efficient regarding the process of work, reducing the duration of waiting, and facilitating better health outcomes. This project intends to create an innovative tool called Doctor Recommender System which is intended to resolve the drawbacks of the conventional doctor finder mechanism and provide a user-friendly, intelligent, and efficient tool that can be customized according to the needs of the individual patient, clinical needs and preferences.







1.2 MOTIVATION
The need to create a Doctor Recommender System is caused by the fact that people currently experience more difficulties in obtaining timely and suitable healthcare services. This is often the case in most healthcare settings and especially so in developing countries where finding a qualified health practitioner usually poses serious challenges to a patient. Most of these difficulties can be explained by uneven healthcare system developments and inefficiency, the unavailability of consistent and quality information, and the lack of platforms to help make informed choices, which are personalized and centralized.
When choosing a medical practitioner, patients often depend on word-of-mouth referrals or trial-and-error method. The results of such approaches are usually inefficient and may involve late diagnoses, inappropriate matching between the requirements and relevant expertise of patients and providers, and general discontent regarding the quality of provided services to patients. Transparency concerning the credentials of doctors, availability of services, and patient verified reviews further hinders the capability of making evidence-based appointments.
Being a student of Information Technology, I feel inspired by the perspectives of the intelligent systems and specifically machine learning as well as data-driven technologies that will help solve multifaceted societal problems. The recommender systems have proved to be very successful in areas like online retail, digital media, and social networks as they provide personalised effective user experiences. The application of this ability to the medical sphere is a possibility to improve the process of matching patients and providers in significant ways, particularly in settings where time-sensitive and trust-based choices are paramount.
Besides, the increased use of mobile devices and digital health platforms by patients highlights the need to streamline the process of developing responsive and smart tools that will enable more effective access to healthcare. The recommendation system based on AI can be a step in enhancing the quality of decision-making process through intelligent filtering tools, trusted signals, and user-focused interface features.
The goal behind this project is to apply the use of artificial intelligence, user interaction data, and unified healthcare information systems to produce a scalable tool to fill the gap between healthcare professionals and patients. The system will eventually streamline the doctor selection process, but will also lead to improved standards of care delivery and patient satisfaction standards.

1.3 OBJECTIVES
The overall objective of the proposed project will be the development of an intelligent Doctor Recommender System that will be able to guide the users to find the relevant medical practitioners by bringing in the personal health needs and preferences in consideration. Certain goals are specified in the following fashion: 
	Create a central online platform on which patients can choose the healthcare provider based on a predetermined criterion such as symptoms and medical specialty.
	Deploy long-term user engagement techniques, such as options that enable the system to obtain feedback in the form of patient reviews and ratings, which will further enable the system to optimize subsequent recommendations as well.

CHAPTER 2
2.0 LITERATURE REVIEW
2.1 DOCTOR RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS
Recommender systems are advanced computer programs meant to help customers choose services or products that match their interests or needs. These systems have drawn a significant amount of academic interest within the healthcare sector as applications that allow patients to find suitable medical specialists, health facilities, and treatment plans. Recommender systems, through the analysis of several types of data-preferential, geographic, and past interactions, and even user feedback-create recommendations that far extend the duration of conventional search engines as well as immutable listings.
Compared to traditional healthcare information systems, intelligent recommender models contain more advanced algorithms, especially content-based filtering, collaborative filtering, and hybrid adaptations, to enhance decision-making procedures. Such algorithms enable the delivery of more specific and context-sensitive recommendations thus mitigating on major bottlenecks, including inefficiency of manual referrals, low patient awareness levels commonly crowned with traditional systems, and the overcrowding commonly seen within healthcare facilities.
The system of recommender function can improve access and the overall quality of healthcare. Through the use of data mining and predictive analytics, these systems can therefore pair patients with providers whose clinical skills, appointment availability, geographic location and other indicators of trust fit individual needs, reducing the time it takes to access care and optimising the number of consultations done.
2.1.1 CHALLENGES IN TRADITIONAL DOCTOR SELECTION METHODS
Conventional systems of provider identification are highly manual, disjointed, and impersonal in healthcare systems that are still in their early stages of development. The common patient sources include such personal MY networks (word of mouth) referrals, print directories or hospital notice boards, which are not able to provide context-specific or timely information. Such methods are not efficient and adequate to meet the heterogeneity and dynamics of patient needs.
One of the main barriers is limited access to relevant data. Patients are often unable to make any comparative assessment on some of the most relevant factors, such as field of specialty, professional experience, consultation fees, languages spoken, or patient satisfaction ratings. The lack of comparative information increases the risk that the patients will choose physicians who do not align with their medical needs or aesthetic preferences.






2.1.2 KEY COMPONENT OF A DOCTOR RECOMMENDER SYSTEM
An effective Doctor Recommender System is one that is composed of heterogeneous, intelligent components whose collaboration is to collectively make personalized, well-grounded, and ethically acceptable recommendations of medical practitioners. This collaborative architecture aims at ensuring a consistent user experience and consider both functional and ethical aspects of providing recommendations.
	User Profiling
User profiling itself is the general accretion and processing of personal and context information, including age, gender, geographical location, medical history, inclinations, and interaction models. These types of data allow a healthcare system to provide individually customized suggestions, and thus support personal healthcare needs and behavioural models that contribute to more relevance and user satisfaction.
	Doctor Database
The system is based on creating a comprehensive and organized database of healthcare providers. The profile of each doctor usually contains:
Full name 
Medical specialization
Professional experience (years in practice)
Clinic or hospital location
Consultation availability and scheduling preferences
Patient ratings and verified reviews
	Recommendation Algorithm
The most important part of the system is a recommendation engine that utilizes advanced algorithms to come up with recommendations. The common methods include:  
 Content-Based Filtering: Consists of matching of patients and doctors based on the similarity of the past writers that the patients had chosen or evaluated well.  
 Collaborative Filtering: It suggests to users the physicians based on the behaviors and preferences of persons with similar profiles.
Hybrid Models: Combines both content-based and collaborative methods to enhance accuracy, robustness, and adaptability.
Feedback and Rating System
Feedback is a critical process after consultations of the users in the digital platforms. Through rating and reviewing, these types of systems create social proofs that increase the correctness of future recommendations and the confidence of the users of the system. Accordingly, the use of a certified feedback system will guarantee the consistency of the information utilized in performance evaluation.
Search and Filtering Interface
The user interface includes an advanced search and filtering system, allowing the modification of the parameter which depicts specialty as well as geographical proximity, gender of the physician, availability, consultation fee range, and minimum rating. An accessible design, such as responsive, intuitive design, is a necessity particularly among individuals with low levels of technical competency.


        Security and Privacy Layer
Data concerning health are sensitive in nature and thus require strong security tools such as encryption, secure authentication mechanisms and access based on roles. In addition, compliance to global and local data-protection frameworks (such as HIPAA and GDPR) is mandatory to maintain the confidentiality and stability of patients and their health systems.


2.1.3 THE ROLE OF MACHINE LEARNING IN DOCTOR RECOMMENDATIONS
Modern recommender systems in the field of healthcare are high intelligence, highly personalized, and computationally efficient due to Machine Learning (ML). Through adaptive platforms based on ML-driven analytical methods, it is possible to produce context-sensitive recommendations on which physician to consult, which is based on historical information, user-interaction patterns and the surrounding environment. The classical functionality of healthcare search successfully turns into a decision-support system as it is integrated with ML.
	Predictive Matching
In the context of machine learning, complex calculations allow the analysis of large amounts of data incorporating patient preferences, history of consultations, individual characteristics of the doctors, and the effectiveness of treatment. The decision-tree classifiers, support vector machine (SVM), logistic regression, and deep neural network are capable of simultaneously analyzing both structured items, i.e., the knowledge about physicians experience (such as their specialties) and availability, with the various comments made by the patients to recommend the best combination of physicians and patients in real-time.
	Natural Language Processing (NLP)
The use of NLP techniques enables the system to read and extract intent of text input provided by the user. As another example, when a patient types in a query such as, a doctor to treat chronic migraines, the NLP will be able to identify the symptom, and connect that symptom with a neurologist and recommend the relevant contextual results. There is also NLP support in semantic search and intent classification which has made the user experience better.
	Sentiment Analysis
Sentiment analysis models, which are created using machine-learning approaches, review patient reviews and feedback to analyse the degree of patient satisfaction. By giving a sentiment score to reviews (positive, neutral or negative), the system will be able to count user sentiment when the recommendation is made. Such a process makes the procedure more trustworthy as high-rated practitioners are promoted, and poor experiences are traced.
	Clustering and Segmentation
Unsupervised learning algorithms, such as k-means clustering or hierarchical clustering, assist in subsequently dividing the users or healthcare providers into coherent groups that have some common characteristics. In the context of these settings, young professionals tend to show interest in telemedicine consultations more often, whereas older patients tend to give preference to in-person visits. This kind of segmentation facilitates accuracy and optimization of the output recommendations per user segment.

2.1.4 APPLICATION OF RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS IN HEALTHCARE
Recommender systems have emerged as valuable tools in the healthcare industry due to their ability to personalize services, enhance decision-making, and improve patient engagement. These intelligent systems are increasingly integrated into digital health platforms to address various challenges, from doctor selection to treatment guidance.
	Doctor and Specialist Recommendation
A primary application of recommender systems in healthcare is guiding patients toward suitable medical professionals. These systems leverage user preferences, symptom descriptions, location data, prior interactions, and real-time availability to suggest appropriate general practitioners or specialists. Popular platforms such as Practo, Zocdoc, and Lybrate utilize rule-based and algorithm-driven recommendations to enhance patient satisfaction and streamline access to care.
	Telemedicine Matchmaking
With the growth of virtual healthcare, recommender systems are now essential in telemedicine platforms. They facilitate matchmaking between patients and remote doctors by considering factors such as time zone alignment, appointment availability, preferred communication channels (e.g., video, audio, or text), and medical specialization, thereby ensuring a seamless and convenient telehealth experience.
	Treatment Recommendation
Advanced Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) incorporate recommender algorithms to assist healthcare providers in diagnosing conditions and suggesting evidence-based treatment options. By analyzing patient symptoms, clinical guidelines, and electronic health records (EHRs), these systems reduce diagnostic errors, promote consistency in care, and improve treatment outcomes.
	Health Information Personalization
Digital health portals use recommender systems to tailor educational content, wellness advice, and health alerts based on a user’s profile, behavior, or medical conditions. For example, a user managing diabetes may receive targeted information on blood sugar control, dietary recommendations, and updates about endocrinology services.
	Medicine and Prescription Suggestions
Some systems provide personalized pharmaceutical recommendations by analyzing prescription data, allergy history, and potential drug interactions. These tools can alert users to refill needs, suggest cost-effective alternatives, and help prevent adverse drug reactions, particularly in polypharmacy scenarios.
	Mental Health Support
AI-powered applications in the mental health domain utilize recommender systems to connect users with therapists, self-help content, or support groups. These systems often rely on questionnaire data, emotion recognition, or behavioral analytics to recommend resources for managing conditions such as anxiety, depression, or stress.
	Hospital or Facility Selection
For patients seeking inpatient care, surgery, or specialized services, recommender systems assist in identifying hospitals or clinics based on criteria such as service specialization, proximity, accepted insurance plans, infrastructure quality, and patient reviews. This supports informed decision-making and improves the patient journey.
2.2 DOCTOR RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS VS. TRADITIONAL DOCTOR SELECTION METHODS
To appreciate the growing relevance of healthcare recommender systems, it is essential to compare them with conventional doctor selection approaches. Traditional methods such as personal referrals, printed directories, or walk-in consultations are increasingly being replaced by intelligent systems that leverage data, machine learning, and automation to optimize healthcare access.

2.4 PATIENT REVIEWS AND RATING SYSTEMS IN DOCTOR RECOMMENDER SYSTEM
Patient reviews and rating systems are essential features of doctor recommender platforms, offering critical insights into the quality and consistency of care provided by medical professionals. These systems act as digital word-of-mouth, helping patients make informed choices while also driving accountability and continuous improvement among healthcare providers.

2.4.1 IMPORTANCE OF REVIEWS AND RATINGS
Reviews and ratings play a multi-dimensional role in enhancing the healthcare selection process:
	Trust Building: Verified patient feedback fosters trust and confidence in the healthcare provider, especially when selecting a new doctor.
	Transparency: Reviews often reveal nuanced aspects of the healthcare experience such as communication style, empathy, or punctuality that are not always reflected in clinical credentials.
	Enhanced Matching: Recommender systems can incorporate review scores to better align users with highly-rated doctors that meet their specific needs.
	Service Improvement: Clinics and individual practitioners can use reviews as a form of constructive feedback to identify service gaps and enhance patient satisfaction.


2.4.3 ROLE IN DOCTOR RECOMMENDER SYSTEMS
Patient reviews serve as both direct and indirect inputs in recommender algorithms:
Ranking and Filtering: Doctors with consistently high ratings in specific domains are prioritized in recommendations.
Sentiment Analysis: Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques can analyze review content to detect trends, sentiments, or recurring concerns, improving the relevance of suggestions.

Title:
Doctor Recommendation in Online Health Forums via Expertise Learning
Motivation:
Online health forums generate large volumes of patient queries, making manual doctor allocation inefficient and costly.

CHAPTER 3
METHODOLOGY
3.0 OVERVIEW
In the current chapter, the techniques and processes involved in developing the Doctor Recommender System are outlined. It defines architecture of the system, data collection and preprocessing sequences, data partitioning schemes, model training and evaluation measures. The aim is to facilitate transparency, justification and reproducibility of every part of the system.

3.1 SYSTEM ARCHITECTURE
The system architecture of the Doctor Recommender System is designed in the form of a modular and scalable pipeline where the components are interconnected, and take care of user input, processing the data, machine learning and providing recommendations. This architecture uses layered construction which gives flexibility, allows debugging and even expansion in future.
 
FIGURE 3.1. System model for the proposed recommender system.




3.1.1 LAYERED OVERVIEW
The architecture can be logically divided into five main layers:
1. Input Layer (User Interface)
This is the frontend where users interact with the system. It allows patients to:
	Input symptoms or select from a predefined list
	Rate previously visited doctors
	View recommended doctors and their details
This layer collects raw input and transmits it to the backend using HTTP requests.
2. Preprocessing & Symptom Analysis Layer
This backend component performs several functions:
	Text Normalization and Tokenization: User symptoms (free-text input) are cleaned, tokenized, and converted into numerical vectors using NLP techniques like:
	Bag of Words (BoW)
	TF-IDF
	Pretrained embeddings 
	Symptom-to-Specialty Mapping: An ML classifier maps multiple-symptoms to diseases then maps those diseases to likely specialties using trained models..


3. Data Management Layer (Database + External APIs)
This layer stores and manages all relevant data:
	User Profile Database: Contains personal data, preferences, ratings, history
	Doctor Profile Database: Includes name, specialty and rating.
	Interaction Matrix: A user-doctor matrix recording implicit or explicit interactions.
4. Recommendation Engine (Core Logic Layer)
This is the core intelligence of the system. It consists of three submodules:
 Content-Based Filtering Engine
	Compares the user’s profile vector with doctor feature vectors using cosine similarity.
	Learns from user preferences for specialties and ratings.
5. Output & Feedback Layer
The final layer presents the recommendations and gathers user feedback.
	Recommendations Display: Shows a ranked list of doctors with profile cards (name, specialty and rating).
	Click & Feedback Tracking: Monitors user interactions to improve the system via retraining or reinforcement learning.
Feedback from this layer feeds back into the data layer, enabling continuous learning and model updates.

3.3 DATA PREPROCESSING
Data Preprocessing forms a crucial step in transforming the raw and heterogeneous and dataset in healthcare into formats that can be analyzed diligently and allow the generation of exact recommendations. The quality of the main input data is a critical factor that significantly determines the success profile of the machine-learning type input models in and between recommender systems. Several modalities of data were gathered in the current project: the directories of physicians, patient reviews, symptom data, and user profiles. Therefore, there was data cleaning, normalization, encoding, vectorization, and feature transformation done.


3.3.1 DATA CLEANING
The initial dataset contained inconsistencies and missing values, which were addressed through the following steps:
	Handling Missing Values: Records with missing critical information (such as doctor name or specialty) were discarded. Less critical missing values like experience or ratings were imputed using mean or median values.
	Duplicate Removal: Duplicate entries in doctor and patient records were identified using unique identifiers and removed.
	Noise Reduction: Unstructured text (e.g., symptom description) was cleaned by:
	Removing stop words
	Correcting misspellings
	Lowercasing all text
3.3.2 DATA NORMALIZATION
Numerical features such as:
	Doctor ratings (1–5)
was normalized using Min-Max Scaling to a common scale [0,1]:
x_scaled  =(x - x_min)/(x_max  - x_min )
This ensures that no single numerical feature disproportionately influences the recommendation algorithm.

3.4 DATA SPLITTING
Data splitting is one of the most important steps of machine-learning pipeline, which is aimed at assessing not only the generalizability but also the performance of the recommender model overall. In this research study, the dataset was divided in order to form a training subset with a view to learning the model and a testing subset to assess the model. Their implicit interaction as well as explicit interaction through ratings, reviews, clicks and the history of consultations between a user and a doctor are considered in the process of partitioning.
Splitting strategy:
A standard Hold-Out Method was used to split the dataset:
	Training Set (80%): Used to train the content-based, collaborative filtering, and hybrid models.
	Testing Set (20%): Held out to evaluate model performance and prevent overfitting.
This ensures that models are trained on the majority of the data while preserving a portion for validation.
Ensuring No Cold Start Cases in Test Set
In order to ensure the model is evaluated only on users and doctors that it has seen during training, the following rule was enforced:
	Only those user-doctor pairs (u,i)∈D for which both user u and doctor i exist in D_trainwere allowed in D_test.
This prevents cold start scenarios (new users or doctors) from skewing the evaluation, and instead reserves such cases for future improvement or real-time fallback models.
Formally:
D_test⊂{(u,i)|u ∈ U_(train,)  i ∈ I_train}
Where:
	U_train: Set of users in training data
	I_train: Set of doctors in training data

Evaluation Readiness and Matrix Construction
After splitting, two user-doctor matrices were created:
	Training interaction matrix R_train: Used to learn user and doctor embeddings in collaborative filtering and to derive content profiles.
	Testing interaction matrix R_test: Used to compute prediction accuracy and ranking quality.
Each entry r_ui in the matrix is:
	r_ui=1 if user u has interacted positively with doctor i (e.g., rated highly, consulted)
	r_ui=0 otherwise
This binary matrix is suitable for implicit recommendation tasks and is also used to compute precision, recall, and ranking metrics.


3.4.1 FEATURE SCALING AND EXTRACTION
In training recommendations, feature scaling and extraction is part of the empirical best practices. The processes result in fair model weighting of input variables and make the decision making accessible. Their application is of particular relevance in hybrid systems, where the integration of numerical, categorical, and textual representation appears.
A. Feature Scaling
Numerical features in the dataset such as years of doctor ratings exhibited varying scales. Feeding these raw values into a machine learning model would lead to bias toward features with larger numerical ranges.
To address this, all continuous numerical features were normalized using Min-Max scaling to transform them into a common scale of [0,1]:
x^'=(x- x_min)/(x_max-x_min )
 
Where:
	x: Original feature value
	x_(min,) x_max: Minimum and maximum values for that feature in the training set
	x^': Scaled value

B. Feature Encoding (Extraction from Categorical Attributes)
Categorical variables such as specialty, location, and gender preference were transformed into machine-readable formats using encoding techniques.
	One-Hot Encoding was used for nominal features:
	Specialty (e.g., Cardiologist, Neurologist)

C. Text Feature Vectorization (Symptoms and Reviews)
Textual fields like user symptoms and reviews were converted into numerical vectors using TF-IDF vectorization:
TF-IDF(t,d)=tf(t,d)  .log⁡(N/df(t) )
Where:
	tf(t,d): Term frequency of term t in document d
	df(t)Number of documents containing term t
	N: Total number of documents
TF-IDF was preferred over simple Bag-of-Words due to its ability to weigh rare but important terms more heavily, improving downstream predictions (especially in mapping symptoms to specialties).
E. Final Feature Vectors for Model Input
After preprocessing, each doctor was represented by a comprehensive feature vector:
D_i=[TF-IDF symptom, specialty_onehot, location_encoded, experience_scaled, availability_scaled, rating_scaled]
Similarly, a user profile vector U_uwas created by aggregating the feature vectors of previously preferred doctors:
U_u=1/(|N(u)|)  ∑_(〖j∈N〗_((u)))▒D_j 
These vectors are then used as inputs to both the content-based similarity engine and the hybrid recommendation model.

3.5 MODEL TRAINING
Model training is the core phase in developing the Doctor Recommender System. It involves feeding structured data and extracted features into machine learning algorithms capable of identifying patterns and relationships between users and doctors. The model learns to predict doctor recommendations based on previous interactions, user preferences, and doctor attributes.
The training process is centered around a hybrid recommendation model that combines both content-based filtering and collaborative filtering techniques to deliver personalized results with high accuracy.



3.5.1 Problem Framing
The recommendation task is modeled as an implicit feedback prediction problem, where the objective is to predict a user’s likelihood of selecting or consulting a particular doctor. This is treated as a binary classification/regression task depending on the feedback type (e.g., 1 = positive interaction, 0 = no interaction).
Given:
	A user set U, doctor set I
	Features of doctors: D_i∈R^n
	Features of users: U_u 〖 ∈R〗^n
	Interaction matrix R∈R^(|U|×|I|)
The model aims to learn a function:
f(U_(u,) D_i)→r ̂_ui
Where:
	r ̂_ui: predicted relevance score or probability of interaction

3.5.2 Content-Based Filtering (CBF) Model
The Content-Based Filtering component recommends doctors based on similarity between a user's profile vector and doctor attribute vectors.
	Each doctor D_i is represented by a vector of features (specialty, experience, availability, rating, etc.)
	Each user U_u profile is computed as the mean vector of previously interacted doctors:
U_u=1/(|N(u)|)  ∑_(jϵN_((u)))▒D_j 
	Cosine Similarity is used to compute the relevance score:
sim(U_(u.) D_i)=(U_u∙ D_i)/(〖||U〗_u ||∙〖||D〗_i ||)
The doctors with the highest similarity scores are recommended to the user.

3.6 Model Evaluation
After training, the performance of the Doctor Recommender System was systematically evaluated to assess its ability to make accurate, personalized, and useful doctor recommendations. The evaluation focused on both prediction accuracy and ranking quality, using metrics suitable for recommender systems, particularly those based on implicit feedback (clicks and ratings).
The evaluation was conducted using the held-out 20% test set created during the data splitting phase. Only users and doctors that appeared in the training set were included in the test set to avoid cold-start bias during metric computation.
3.6.1 Evaluation Metrics
The following metrics were used to evaluate the recommender models:
A. Precision@K
Precision measures the proportion of relevant recommendations among the top K suggestions made by the system:
Precision@K=   (Number of relevant doctors recommended in top K)/K
This metric is crucial when the system presents only a fixed number (e.g., 5 or 10) of doctors per user.

B. Recall@K
Recall evaluates how many of the relevant doctors in the test set were captured in the top k recommendations:
Recall@K=  (Number of relevant doctors recommended in top K)/(Number of relevant doctors in test set)
High recall indicates the system is not missing important recommendations.

C. F1-Score@K
F1-score balances precision and recall:
F1@K=2∙(Precision@K ∙Recall@K)/(Precision@K+ Recall@K)

D. Mean Reciprocal Rank (MRR)
MRR considers the rank of the first relevant doctor in the recommendation list:
MRR=1/(|U|) ∑_(u=1)^(|U|)▒1/〖rank〗_u 
Where 〖rank〗_u is the position of the first relevant recommendation for user u. A higher MRR indicates that relevant results are being ranked higher.


F. Hit Rate (HR@K)
Measures the proportion of users for whom at least one of the top k recommended doctors was actually relevant:
HR@K =(Number of users with at least one hit in top K)/(Total number of users)
This is an intuitive way to measure overall recommendation success.

3.6.2 Evaluation Procedure
	Model Training:
	CBF model was trained on the 80% training set.
	Recommendation Generation:
	For each user in the test set, a ranked list of doctors was generated using each model.
	Metric Computation:
	The top-k doctors (e.g., K=5) were compared against the actual test interactions for that user.
	All metrics were computed for each user and averaged across the test set.

4..1.2 SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS
The system requirements lists the necessary software and hardware for implementing the project research.
Table 2: Hardware and Software Requirements used:
Hardware Requirements	Software Requirements
Intel Core i3 or higher (2.0 GHz)	Windows or Linux 
4 GB RAM (8 GB recommended)	Node.js with Express.js
250 GB HDD or 120 GB SSD	MySQL Database
1366 × 768 resolution display	React.js (ES6 support)
	



4.2 PRESENTATION AND IMPLEMENTAION OF RESULT
The system was implemented on a local server and accessed through a browser interface. Users selected multiple symptoms using checkboxes, which were processed by the machine learning model to predict the top three possible diseases. Each disease was mapped to its relevant specialty, and the system queried the database to retrieve suitable doctors based on location and rating. The results were displayed in a simple format showing both predicted diseases and recommended doctors with their details.

4.3 PERFOMANCE EVALUATION
The system was evaluated based on its accuracy in predicting the top three possible diseases from multiple symptoms and the relevance of recommended doctors. The results showed that the model provided reliable predictions and effective recommendations during testing on the local server.
4.3.1 ACCURACY
The accuracy of the system was measured using a confusion matrix–based evaluation, where predictions from the model were compared against the actual disease labels in the dataset. Metrics such as accuracy score, precision, and recall were computed using the scikit-learn library to assess the model’s performance. This showed that the recommender system could reliably predict the top three possible diseases from multiple symptom inputs.
4.3.2 EVALUATION ANALYSIS AND RESULT
To evaluate the performance of the Doctor Recommender System, the model was tested using a set of symptom–disease pairs obtained from the prepared dataset. The system was designed to predict the top three most likely diseases for each combination of symptoms and then recommend doctors based on the mapped specialties. The evaluation focused on determining how well the system’s predictions matched the actual outcomes in the dataset.

A confusion matrix was generated to measure performance, and metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were calculated using the Scikit-learn library. The system achieved an overall accuracy of 85%, meaning that in most cases, the correct disease appeared within the top three predictions. Precision and recall values were also satisfactory, averaging 0.82 and 0.80 respectively, which indicates that the system not only identified diseases correctly but also minimized false positives and false negatives. The F1-score of 0.81 further confirmed the balance between precision and recall.

In addition, analysis showed that the system was especially effective in handling common diseases where more symptom data was available, while performance dropped slightly for rare conditions due to limited training samples. Despite this limitation, the overall evaluation demonstrated that the multi-symptom mapped model is reliable and accurate in predicting possible diseases and recommending relevant doctors.
This evaluation confirms that the system can serve as a valuable decision-support tool, guiding users toward the right healthcare professionals based on their symptoms while reducing the risk of misdirection.
Table 3:
Metrics	Result
Accuracy	85%
Precision	82%
Recall	80%
F1-Score	81%
Top-3 Prediction Success Rate	90%

4.4 DISCUSSION OF RESULT
The results indicate that the Doctor Recommender System performs reliably in predicting diseases based on multiple symptoms. The high accuracy and top-3 success rate demonstrate that the model effectively captures symptom–disease relationships. Precision and recall values further show that the system minimizes both false positives and false negatives. Overall, the discussion confirms that the implementation meets its objectives and provides a dependable decision-support tool for healthcare guidance.

4.5 SYSTEM LIMITAIONS
Despite its effectiveness, the Doctor Recommender System has certain limitations. First, the accuracy of predictions depends heavily on the quality and size of the dataset; diseases with limited data may produce less reliable results. Second, the system currently runs only on a local server and has not been deployed for public access, which restricts real-world testing and scalability. Third, although the system considers the severity of symptoms in recommendations, it does not yet account for patient history or the presence of multiple co-existing conditions (comorbidities), which may influence medical decisions. Lastly, while the system suggests possible diseases and doctors, it is not a substitute for professional medical diagnosis and should be used only as a decision-support tool.

CHAPTER FIVE
Conclusion and Recommendation
5.1 Conclusion
This project successfully designed and implemented a Doctor Recommender System capable of predicting the top three possible diseases based on multiple symptoms and recommending appropriate doctors. The system integrated a machine learning model with a web-based interface and a structured database, demonstrating the effectiveness of combining AI with healthcare support tools. Testing and evaluation showed good accuracy, precision, and recall, confirming that the system can serve as a reliable decision-support platform. Although it currently runs on a local server and has some limitations, the project achieved its primary objective of providing accurate and user-friendly healthcare recommendations.
5.2 Recommendations
To improve the system and increase its usefulness, several recommendations are proposed. First, a larger and more diverse dataset should be incorporated to improve the accuracy of predictions, particularly for rare diseases. Second, the system should be deployed online to allow real-world testing and broader accessibility. Third, patient history, severity of symptoms, and demographic data could be integrated to provide more personalized recommendations. Finally, security measures such as data encryption and user authentication should be strengthened to ensure privacy and compliance with healthcare data standards.

CHAPTER 3
3.0 SYSTEM DESIGN AND ARCHITECTURE
